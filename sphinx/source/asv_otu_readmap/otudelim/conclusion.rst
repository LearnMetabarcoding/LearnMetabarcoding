If you've now tried all of the methods, the :ref:`comparing OTU delimitation methods <comparing_otus>` tutorial outlines some ways to compare these methods and some hints for selecting a method and parameters. 

Once you have a final set of OTUs and an associated record of ASVs within each OTU, you can proceed with these two files to the :ref:`mapping reads <mapping_reads>` subsection to learn about mapping your reads to your OTUs. Later on, we'll also use the OTU sequences to generate a phylogeny of our OTUs in the :ref:`Building OTU phylogeny <phylogeny>` section, and to retrieve taxonomic identifications and/or classifications for the OTU sequences in the :ref:`Identifying OTU sequences <otuid>` section.
