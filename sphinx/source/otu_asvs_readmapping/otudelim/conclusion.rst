If you've now tried all three methods, the :ref:`Comparing OTU Delimitation methods <comparing_otus>` subsection outlines some ways to compare these methods and some hints for selecting a method and parameters. Once you have a final set of OTUs and an associated record of ASVs within each OTU, you can proceed with these two files to the :ref:`Mapping Reads <mapping_reads>` section to learn about mapping your reads to your OTUs. Later on, we'll also use the OTU sequences to generate a phylogeny of our OTUs in the :ref:`Building OTU Phylogeny <phylogeny>` section, and to retrieve taxonomic identifications and/or classifications for the OTU sequences in the :ref:`Identifying OTU Sequences <otuid>` section.
