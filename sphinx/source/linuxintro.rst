The linux command line interface (CLI) provides a versatile low-level environment for processing DNA sequence data. The majority of the software used in bioinformatic pipelines are written for the linux command line, so understanding how to use this interface is important for mastering metabarcoding bioinformatics. In this section we will introduce you to the command line interface and give an overview of the basic commands you need to navigate a linux operating system. We will discuss some common linux tools that can be applied to DNA sequence data. It is important to be familiar with the concepts covered in this section before progressing with the bioinformatic sections: understanding the command line will make the syntax and context of later sections much clearer, and aid you in troubleshooting if something doesn't work.

Once you feel comfortable enough with linux, you can move on to the the :ref:`read processing<read_processing>` section.
