What if we have a more variable region? Extension
======================================================================

What if we have a coding region like CO1 where we expect no single-base indels, but overall the region is more variable (or we have a wider range of taxa) and we might see real established whole-codon insertions or deletions?

* Briefly think about how we might specify a filter for this - assuming the same target length of 418bp, what lengths might we allow?

As it happens, it doesnâ€™t seem that there are any programs out there that do this filtering already. One way to do it is filter by each length separately, and then concatenate the results - so, allowing one codon of variation, we would do:

.. code-block:: bash 

	$ for l in 415 418 421; do \
	> vsearch --fastx_filter mbc_concat.fastq --fastq_minlen $l \
	> --fastq_maxlen $l --fastaout mbc_concat_${l}_ctrim.fasta; \ 
	> done && cat *ctrim.fasta

We would want to make sure that worked properly by checking the number of sequences in the relevant files:

.. code-block:: 

	$ grep -c "^>" *ctrim.fasta
