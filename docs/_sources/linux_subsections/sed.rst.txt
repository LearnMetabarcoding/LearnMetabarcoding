The sed command
======================================

The ``sed`` command is another tool that uses Regular Expressions, see the page on the ``grep`` command for more information on these. ``sed`` is used for performing edits to a text file. Probably the most common use of ``sed`` is to perform find-and-replace type operations, but it can also be used for many other things.
