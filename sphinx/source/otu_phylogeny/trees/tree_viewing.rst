Download both of these trees to your computer and open them using FigTree, Dendroscope or similar to view the tree.

We know these trees aren’t going to be perfect because we’ve used a very fast method to get here, without tweaking alignments or tree-building methods. This is a good chance to look for features of trees that aren’t quite right:

* Check to see whether, in general, the taxonomy of your terminals matches the clade structure of the tree

* Check to see whether there are very long branches

* Are there any very long branches? Why might this be?

* Are the OTUs placed as expected based on the taxonomic assignments?

Are there substantial differences between the trees? Which looks better?

Remember, the taxonomic assignments of the OTUs are not certain, so we shouldn’t really base our assessment of this tree’s accuracy on them.

Keep the trees up. We will discuss them as a group when everyone’s at this stage.

If you're interested in making trees for your CROP and swarm OTUs, have a look at this :ref:`extension task<tree_comparison>`.

In the next session we will be :ref:`OTU phylogenetic placement! <phylogenetic_placement>`.
