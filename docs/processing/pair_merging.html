<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These metabarcoding libraries were sequenced such that 300bp of our fragment was read from each end. When we designed our primers from complete mitochondrial genome sequences, we examined the expected amplicon and we know that there should be <strong>418bp</strong> of sequence between the primers. Given that this is much shorter than 2 x 300 = 600, there should be overlap between the forward and reverse fragments, and we can use this to assemble the complete amplicon sequence</p>
<div class="admonition-exercise admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You know from previous sections how much index and primer sequence was trimmed from each end. How much sequence should we have left in each direction?</p></li>
<li><p>How much should these sequences overlap?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="toggle admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Solution</p>
<p>The forward primer is 20 bases long, plus a 6 base index gives 26 bases. Thus the forward reads should be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(300 - 26 = 274\)</span> bases long now
The reverse primer is 26 bases long, plus a 6 base index gives 32 bases. Thus the reverse reads should be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(300 - 32 = 268\)</span> bases long now</p>
<p>The total amount of read sequence is therefore 274 + 268 = 542 bases. Since the fragment was only 418 bp, this leaves 542 - 418 = 124 overlapping bases.</p>
<p>For further illustration, consider this miniture version: here our reads are 10 bases long and the overall sequenced region is 14 bases. The length of the overlap is 10 + 10 - 14</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><strong>R1</strong>  AACGTAGCAA
<strong>R2</strong>      TAGCAAGCAT</pre>
</div>
<p>The overlap between our reads is definitely enough to be able to confidently assemble each pair together, and each pair of the primer-trimmed files can now become one.</p>
<div class="green admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Data and software</p>
<p>The input data for this tutorial is a directory of FASTQ format file pairs, one pair per sample, with no index or primer sequences. If you’re following along step-by-step, this was produced in <a class="reference internal" href="primer_removal.html#primer-removal"><span class="std std-ref">the previous tutorial</span></a>. Alternatively, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2_trimmed</span></code> directory within the <a class="reference internal" href="../data.html#sectionadata"><span class="std std-ref">sectionA archive</span></a> can be used as example data.</p>
<p>This tutorial uses the <a class="reference internal" href="../gettingstarted/setup/installing_software.html#fastqc"><span class="std std-ref">fastQC</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../gettingstarted/setup/installing_software.html#pear"><span class="std std-ref">PEAR</span></a> software.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sequence-quality">
<h2>Sequence quality<a class="headerlink" href="#sequence-quality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An important consideration when pair merging is that, in general, sequence reads decline in quality along their length. This quality information is stored in the FASTQ file - it would be a lot of work to check all of our sequences manually, but there are some ways to summarise the quality scores. It’s good practice to do this with your reads at this point</p>
<p>One very popular option is to use the program <strong>FastQC</strong>. You can run it on a single file like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">fastqc <span class="var">​input.fastq</span></pre>
<p>You can view the output of <strong>FastQC</strong> by using your FTP software (e.g. FileZilla) to access the server, navigating to the directory in which you ran <strong>FastQC</strong> and opening the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.html</span></code> file with the same name as your file. There are lots of useful graphs, but the first one is key here.</p>
<p>The ends away from the primer are the parts that the merging algorithm is attempting to match, and you’ll notice these tend to be lower quality. This leads to two considerations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It is important to be aware of quality scores when merging, since erroneous sequence could cause the merging of reads that are not the same fragment, forming a chimera</p></li>
<li><p>However, merging can actually provide some validation of quality and improve quality scores for the overlap region if it matches.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pair-merging-with-pear">
<h2>Pair merging with PEAR<a class="headerlink" href="#pair-merging-with-pear" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will use <strong>PEAR</strong> for merging. As always, check out the helpfile for <strong>PEAR</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pear</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">help</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Not too many options.</p>
<p>First, <span class="guilabel">create a new directory to to store the results of merging</span>.</p>
<p>Try running the below <strong>PEAR</strong> command on a single pair of your primer-trimmed files from the previous section. The output should be the first part of the name - <strong>PEAR</strong> will add to this for the output files.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">pear -f <span class="var">​input_R1.fastq​</span> -r <span class="var">​input_R2.fastq​</span> -o <span class="var">​merged/output</span></pre>
<p>PEAR gives us some really informative information on the terminal, make sure to review it. As you’ll have seen from the helpfile, there are many different thresholds that can be applied to the merging.</p>
<div class="admonition-exercise admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Run your command again, applying a sensible minimum overlap based on what we calculated earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Run your command again, trying out some different p values and quality thresholds. The former is the threshold probability of an overlap being incorrect, the latter is the threshold score for trimming off low quality read ends.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>We generally set the quality threshold (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-q</span></code>)for trimming low quality ends to 26, and the minimum overlap (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-v</span></code>) to a value around 20-30 bases less than the presumed overlap length. These sequences are pretty good quality so these settings won’t reject much more than the default in this case.</p>
<p>Clean up your experimentation by removing the output files</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-pear-in-a-loop">
<h2>Running <strong>PEAR</strong> in a loop<a class="headerlink" href="#running-pear-in-a-loop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like with <strong>cutadapt</strong> in the <a class="reference internal" href="primer_removal.html#primer-removal"><span class="std std-ref">previous tutorial</span></a>, we can run <strong>PEAR</strong> in a loop to apply it to all of our samples: again, we list our files to find our unique samples, then loop on these and use each sample name to run an iteration of <strong>PEAR</strong>. Make sure to replace <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">output</span></code> with the names of the directory holding your input (index- and primer- trimmed sequences), and the directory into which you want to hold your merged sequences:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">samples=$(ls <span class="var">input</span>/ | cut -d_ -f1 | sort | uniq)
for s in $samples;
do
        pear -f <span class="var">input</span>/${s}_R1.fastq -r <span class="var">input</span>/${s}_R2.fastq \
        -o <span class="var">output</span>/$s -q <span class="var">N</span> -v <span class="var">N</span>;
done</pre>
<p>Make sure to review those terminal outputs! Then <span class="guilabel">list the contents of your output directory</span>, you’ll see files for the assembled, unassembled and discarded reads. We don’t need the latter two, so let’s clean up:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">cd <span class="var">output/</span>
rm *discarded* *unassembled* &amp;&amp; rename -e &quot;s/assembled\.//&quot; *
cd ../</pre>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&amp;&amp;</span></code> here runs both commands on this line one after the other. We could use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">;</span></code> instead, but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&amp;&amp;</span></code> only runs the second command if the first one succeeds. This is important because the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rename</span></code> command uses regular expressions to remove the “assembled followed by a full stop” part from any files with that in the name. If we hadn’t removed any files with “unassembled” in the name, then that would have renamed them too!</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Alternatives</p>
<p>Read merging is a very important and very sensitive step in the pipeline, so it is important to select software that is sufficiently feature-rich and has been developed with careful consideration to the problem.</p>
<p>We use <strong>PEAR</strong> because it’s a standalone read merging tool with a probabilistic approach to the merging task, and it works well for our data. However, it can sometimes be a little temperamental if your reads aren’t precisely paired up or if you have any extraneous very short reads present in your data. Usually in these cases it just fails with a vague error - which isn’t great but is better than doing something wrong.</p>
<p>An alternative to <strong>PEAR</strong> is the <strong>fastq_mergepairs</strong> tool within the <strong>VSEARCH</strong> and <strong>USEARCH</strong> packages. This has slightly fewer options but is very widely used. Another tool frequently used is <a class="reference external" href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH/">FLASH</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sequence-loss-and-threshold-choice">
<h2>Sequence loss and threshold choice<a class="headerlink" href="#sequence-loss-and-threshold-choice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that we lose a large number of sequences here. This is completely normal - we must be very strict at the pair merging step to ensure that:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>We correctly merge a true read pair so as not to generate spurious sequence or erroneously remove sequence</p></li>
<li><p>We do not incorrectly merge a false read pair causing a chimeric sequence</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We achieve this by using strict quality and overlap settings, and thus the quality of your sequence data will play a large role in the extent to which sequences, and indeed complete samples, may be lost at this stage. However, as always, the strictness of the parameters we choose should be guided by our data, research question and context. For example, if you have a comprehensive reference set for your target species, you could perhaps be more lax here, as you can filter out errors later on by strict comparison to your references. Similarly, if your target region was more variable, you might need to be more relaxed in the minimum overlap: you should calculate how much overlap you will have for your longest expected amplicon sequences, then base the threshold on these. However, the smaller the minimum overlap, the more chance that bad read pairs get falsely combined just because they happen to overlap a little.  One option when you have variable sequences is that you could use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-n</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-m</span></code> arguments to set the minimum and maximum length of the merged sequence respectively - this gives a little more control, but doesn’t avoid the issue completely.</p>
<p>As we’ll see when we get to the <a class="reference internal" href="../filtering/quality_filtering.html#quality-filtering"><span class="std std-ref">quality filtering</span></a> tutorial in section B, picking quality thresholds is generally based on what confidence you want to have, not on any a priori property or expectation of the data. The value of 26 we give here is our rule of thumb, but you may want to use something different because you want to have a different level of confidence. Remember, this quality threshold is used to trim the poor-quality ends of the reads before merging to remove data that might prevent correct merging - it has no impact on deciding whether a merge is correct or not (you’d want to look at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-p</span></code> argument for that).</p>
<p>Generally, the most rigorous approach is to be as conservative in your settings as you can.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next-steps">
<h2>Next steps<a class="headerlink" href="#next-steps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We’ve generated complete amplicon sequence reads now, so we’re getting close to being done with read processing.</p>
<p>In our example our read lengths are long enough compared to our fragment length so that they overlap. This isn’t always the case. If there is no overlap then one option is to concatenate the mate pairs instead of merging. The other option would be to use only one of the directions, or to split the pipeline here and analyse each direction separately. If you’d like to know more about concatenation, then take a look at the <a class="reference internal" href="extensions/pair_concat.html#pair-concatenation"><span class="std std-ref">pair concatenation extension</span></a>. This is not necessary for the next steps.</p>
<p>In the next tutorial, we’ll look at bringing all the data together in <a class="reference internal" href="data_concat.html#data-concat"><span class="std std-ref">4. Data concatenation</span></a>.</p>
