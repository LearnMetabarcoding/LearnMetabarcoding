Introduction
=========================

These resources aim to introduce a beginner to the bioinformatics required for metabarcoding through a course of self-guided exercises. These exercises take a set of toy data from the stage of raw sequence reads through to the generation of real biodiversity data for use in a wide range of applications. Each exercise is generally centred around a particular step in metabarcoding, introducing the important concepts of this step, a software tool to perform this step, and key parameters to consider when using this softwarce. The main body of the course consists of a linear sequence of core exercises, with each core exercise building on the results of the previous core exercise and generating data for the next. These core exercises are supplemented by extensions, which explore more advanced topics around a bioinformatic step for those looking for an added challenge. There is also a substantial reference section covering basic topics in bioinformatics to assist those who are just starting out.

While we have made every effort to cover a wide range of metabarcoding bioinfirmatic topics, metabarcoding is a continually evolving field and it's impossible to be comprehensive. This course explicitly focuses on metabarcoding for bulk community samples of arthropods using a protein-coding markers, as distinct from many other forms of metabarcoding such as environmental DNA sequencing, dietary-derived metabarcoding, or microbiome sequencing using ribosomal RNA markers. As such, we do not tackle some areas, such as adaptation of the bioinformatic approaches to degraded DNA, and some areas we do cover may not be relevant, such as translation-based ASV filtering. Nonetheless, the majority of the core concepts are identical across all metabarcoding so we hope this resource will be useful to any metabarcoder, no matter their background.

Pipelines
-------------------------

The course is structured in a linear format to aid learning. In practice, while the final bioinformatic procedure employed by a study will be largely linear, the development of this procedure will be anything but. We strongly recommend against treating the set of tools presented here as a self-contained pipeline that's directly applicable to any metabarcoding. We strongly encourage that the best approach to metabarcoding is to develop a good understanding of the steps required and the tools available first. Then design a pipeline with the principle aim of most appropriately answering your research question, selecting only those steps that are relevant to your research aim and employing them in the most appropriate and efficient manner. There is no one-size-fits-all pipeline for metabarcoding.

Getting started
-------------------------

The practical exercises throughout these resources are designed to be run on a UNIX command line interface to a computer with all the relevant software installed. While the exercises presented here require relatively small computational resources because the data is fairly small, implementing some of these tools on real datasets often requires the computational power of a server. The ideal setup would be a linux server - many research institutions provide these for their researchers, or alternatively you could rent a cloud server. Alternatively, you may be able to run these exercises on a desktop machine, either through use of the Linux subsystem for Windows, using the Mac OS or installing Linux on your own computer. In any case, depending on the resources you have available, you might want to check out the following pages:
* How to get a linux cloud server
* How to install the software needed on Linux (the recommended route)
* How to install the software needed on Mac or Windows

Once you have set up your machine, you will need to download the data [link].
