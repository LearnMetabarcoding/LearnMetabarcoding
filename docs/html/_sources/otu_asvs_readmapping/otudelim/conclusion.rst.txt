Alternatively, if you've tried these already, the :ref:`Comparing OTU Delimitation methods <comparing_otus>` subsection outlines some ways to compare these methods and some hints for selecting a method and parameters. Once you have a final set of OTUs, you can proceed with them to the :ref:`Generating Data <generating_data>` section to learn about mapping your reads to your OTUs and doing taxonomic classification. Later on, we'll use these same OTUs and try to place them onto a phylogenetic tree in the :ref:`Phylogenetic Placement <phylogenetic_placement>` section.
