Content
=======

Finish off software list

Each section main page to have data instructions

Do phylogenetic classification content

Do getting started intro page

Do cloud servers page

Do viewing alignments and viewing phylogenies pages @liam

Update internal links throughout

Add paper citations throughout

Phylogenetic placement - mention other phylogenetic software backbone approaches, pplacer, others?

Add something about file/folder naming conventions to a page


Data
====

Add a page in the root for data and a data directory

For each of the 5 sections, add a zipped directory into the data/ directory with all necessary data - do this as part of the make script, zipping the directories in data_source to the sphinx/docs/data directory.

Data done? for section A.


Standardisation
===============

Apply parsed-literal to all code blocks, apply classes for inputs and comments, remove $ and >

All headings should be sentence case

Every tutorial in the 5 main sections should start with an introduction and end with a next steps section

Most tutorials should have a data and software section, outlining the data required and linking to the software used.

fastq/fasta -> FASTQ/FASTA

Any names of linux base tools, i.e. sed, grep, etc should be presented in ``monospaced`` font.

Any other software should be presented in **boldface**, following capitalisation of the software author

All references to "toy dataset" to "example dataset"

Specifics
=========

Add rm command to unix basics to remove example files

Grep page: switch to AAGAGG, add link to a fastq (Lib1_R1.fastq) and a fasta (?) for testing

Loops - have some example data (some fastas?). Correct commands
