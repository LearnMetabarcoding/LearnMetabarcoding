Pipelines

The course is structured in a linear format to aid learning. In practice, while the final bioinformatic procedure employed by a study will be largely linear, the development of this procedure will be anything but. We strongly recommend against treating the set of tools presented here as a self-contained pipeline that's directly applicable to any metabarcoding. We strongly encourage that the best approach to metabarcoding is to develop a good understanding of the steps required and the tools available first. Then design a pipeline with the principle aim of most appropriately answering your research question, selecting only those steps that are relevant to your research aim and employing them in the most appropriate and efficient manner. There is no one-size-fits-all pipeline for metabarcoding.

TODO: add something discussing the software choices we made and a brief introduction to the packages that are out there.
