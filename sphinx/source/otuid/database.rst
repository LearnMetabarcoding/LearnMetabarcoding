Introduction
============

While it's generally a great idea to barcode a reference set of specimens expected to form part of your metabarcoding samples, it isn't always possible to generate a comprehensive set of references. Furthermore, the use of degenerate primers often means that many taxa outside of your taxon of interest get co-amplified alongside your targets, either as bycatch from sampling, food, endosymbionts or parasites, of the target, or just environmental DNA. It is therefore a major part of most metabarcoding pipelines to try and assign some taxonomic information to our OTUs using publicly available databases. Once this has been performed, it is often useful to use this taxonomic classification to filter our OTU sequences by taxonomy, reducing the OTU sequences to those belonging to to our taxon of interest.
