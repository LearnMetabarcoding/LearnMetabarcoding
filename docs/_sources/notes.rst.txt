The Practical Notes
=========================================================================

These notes are designed to supplement the talks and act as your guide through these different bioinformatic methodologies. The hope is that they will remain useful as a reference in the future.

**This practical is structured in a pipeline-like layout, to reflect the need for ordered steps in many bioinformatic processes. However, we strongly recommend against treating the set of tools presented as a self-contained pipeline for any metabarcoding, metagenomic or tree-building research project. Best practice is always to understand the steps needed, research the available tools and apply the tools and parameters as needed for the specific research questions. There is no one-size-fits-all pipeline for metagenetics.**

Given that we have a wide range of prior experience levels in this course, we have structured the practicals to hopefully offer something interesting to every level. To signpost this, every section is colour-coded, as follows:

.. topic:: Fundamentals 

	These sections address topics that underpin the other sections. Those with experience in the 	topic will probably be familiar with these sections, and may simply want to skim over them. 	Not running code in these sections will not affect later steps.

.. topic:: Core
	

	These sections cover the main steps that need to be run in order to work through the 		practicals.

.. topic:: Extension 
	

	These sections add detail, focusing on points of interest to those who may already have 	experience with the core topic, giving suggestions on areas to explore further. Not running 	code in these sections will not affect later core steps.

Each separate practical session will have a tab in the contents to the left. 

If you reach the end of a page, you’ve hit the next session - pat yourself on the back. Don’t start the next session, if you seem to be ahead of the others, go back and do some more Extension sections.
