Viewing Trees
=============

Introduction
=============

In this subsection we will look at how you can view phylogentic trees using the free software Dendroscope. If you are familiar with Dendroscope or a similar software feel free to skip this section. 
You can download Dendroscope from `here <https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/algorithms-in-bioinformatics/software/dendroscope/>`_


Viewing tree in Dendroscope
============================

To open your tree in Dendroscope you can click on the open file icon in the top menu or navigate to :menuselection:`File --> Open` and then browse and select your file. 
Once your tree has loaded you can click and drag the tree to move it around the screen. Scrolling will stretch or narrow the tree. Pressing control and + or - will zoom the node labels in or out. 

Rerooting a tree in Dendroscope
================================

To reroute a tree you in Dendroscope you must first select the route. To do this navigate to :menuselection:`Select --> Select Root` and then select the root with your cursor. 
Then to reroot your tree navigate to :menuselection:`Edit --> Reroot` and your tree will be rerooted.
